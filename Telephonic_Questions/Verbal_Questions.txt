Q1. Consider the following situation, if due to a pandemic your portfolio takes 95% drop from first valuation.
With the current valuation at 5%, how much % increase on the current amount will take you to the first valuation.

A1. 1900% and not 2000% 
    5% * 19 = 100%
    Therefore, 19*100 = 1900%
